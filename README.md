# PlTableCli

PlTableCli is a CLI gem that, when run in the terminal, will display the top or the bottom of the 2018-19 Premier League Table based on the user's input. The user will then be prompted to enter a number that correlates to the team the user wants more information on. The information for each team is a list that contains the team's full name, nickname, grounds(stadium) and capacity, when the team was founded, owner(s), chairman, manager, and website.
